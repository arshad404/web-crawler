# web-crawler
A minimal Go service that: - Fetches a URL - Extracts metadata (title, description, og: tags, headings, main text) - Returns lightweight classification (product/news/blog/other) - Extracts top topics (keywords) via a simple frequency-based approach - Exposes HTTP endpoints for single URL and batch crawl - Ready for Docker deployment
